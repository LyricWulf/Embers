After rendering, Embers outputs a script file along with the video files in the /Ember Renders/ folder.

The script file will start with `ENCODE` and end with `.cmd`. Running it will turn your .avi parts into a .mp4 file which is much easier to preview and upload to YouTube, etc.

You can delete the ENCODE\*.cmd file and the \*.Mbrs#.avi files after encoding is complete.
