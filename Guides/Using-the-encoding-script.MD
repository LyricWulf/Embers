After rendering, Embers outputs a script file along with the video files in the /Ember Renders/ folder.

Depending on your version of Embers, this script may or may not be configured to work on your system.

To fix this script, right-click and Edit it.

1. Remove the `START  /WAIT /B` from the start of script

2. Remove the `;` from the end of the script.

The script will now work.
